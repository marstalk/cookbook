# social media
- the other day,前几天, i was scroll through the instagram
- so I think to myself. 
- the caption says that, save this for later as a reminder. 
- so basically, they want me to get off the social media but get back on so I can reread
- why I shouldn't have been on in the first place?
- I came across this post
- this got me thinking.
- how you are going to be **catfished** or kidnapped
